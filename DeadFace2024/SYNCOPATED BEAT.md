We found this video clip linked from one of the Lytton Labs MKULTRA websites. It has two mysterious, demonic voices on it.

Our linguists haven’t been able to determine the language: suggestions currently are Sumerian, Mayan, Hittite, Aramaic, Ugaritic, and Akkadian. Others have suggested the language may date back to the time of The Nephilim (a.k.a. “The Fallen Ones”).

It was a widely-held belief in the 1980s that demons could somehow influence rock artists to include their messages in the songs. We are still researching that angle, but that suggestion seems least likely.

The skeptics among us have suggested that the voices are the result of some advanced, unknown version of steganography. Because of the clip’s association with MKULTRA, the voices may serve as activation codes (so PLEASE BE CAREFUL!!!). None of our tools have been able to crack it. Can you help?

Enter the flag in all caps, no spaces, as follows: flag{I NIMROD PRONOUNCE A CURSE ON GILGAMESH}, or whatever other ancient imprecation that the demon(s) utter.

Submit the flag as flag{flag text}

Another rather simple challenge

Challenge gives you a video with  hard rock/metal playing in the background  but you notice something wierd with audio. 

One of my first thoughts of maybe trying to reverse the audio.

If you reverse the video  the video give you the hint  to the flag that it is a band from the 70's that sang a song called " Fly like an eagle time  is slipping slipping"

With that hint I went to trusty google again and simply looked up the song lyrics! 
With that you are lead to the band name and we have found our flag!
