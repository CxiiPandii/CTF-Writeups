DEADFACE extracted a sensitive photo from Lytton Labs. As far as we can tell, it’s just a normal photo of a neighborhood at night, but the man who took the photo insists he saw something else. Here is the man’s original tweet. He later added the following image below.

Submit the flag as flag{flag_text_here}.
